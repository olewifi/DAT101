      <li> In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?

        <p>Yes it is possible. When I first tried to do the loop I only managed to do it with two "for" loops. But after researching a little bit I found out how I could use only one "for" loop.
          By using "," to not end the "sentences" I could put more values in the same position in the for loop. </p>

        <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer. </li>
        
        <p> To achieve an "infinite" loop we have to give a criteria that the commando never will reach. An example of this could be a poorly written while loop where i = 0, while i >= 0, and i++;
          What happens here is that the condition 
        </p>

        <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>

        <p>A computer is quite quick to calculate. But depending on the wide span of the possibilities it will be slowed if there are many possibilities to the answer.

        </p>

        <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?</li>

        <p>Which "for" loop that is nested will be counted different. If we change which "for" loop that is innermost will change the counting.</p>
