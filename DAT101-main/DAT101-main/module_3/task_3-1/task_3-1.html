      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the wake up time is exactly 7, it sends out the message that "I can take the bus to school".
        Meanwhile when the wake up time is NOT exactly 7, there will be no message.
        The program has not been told what happens if the wake up time is something else than 7.
      </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. However the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>What happens now is that if the wake up time is not 7 it will say that "I have to take the car", if the wake up time is exactly 7 the same will happen as in question #1.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If the wake up time is less than 7 or greater than 8 the else command wil be used and "I have to take the car". If it is exactly 8 it will say "I can take the train"</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>In the program we are asking it to sort numbers like this "if number > 0, sort it as positive, if not it is negative". And since 0 is not bigger than 0 it will be told it is negative.   </p>
