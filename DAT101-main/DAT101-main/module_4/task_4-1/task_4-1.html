      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>

      <p>It is an organized way to store information and to use it further on. It makes structured programming, easier to read and to use later on. </p>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development</li>

      <p>This is an object that keeps the information about the different account types that exists.
      This type of object is used to store different types of accounts that works differently. This object is useful in 
      software development to use for other type of objects.
      </p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>

      <p>By encapsulation we can use the same codes in different parts of the program. It can use the same information
        without the information gets disturbed. 
      </p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>Makes a new "profile" and by using a class we use the same structure with new information.</p>
