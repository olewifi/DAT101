      <li>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>

      <p>Creating a function means that you are giving the function instructions to execute when called upon.
        Invoking the function is calling the function and it begins to execute the instructions that has been given.
        The difference is that creating does not mean the code is being executed, while invoking it does.
      </p>


        <li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>

        <p>Semicolons helps the program understand when a statement ends and the next one begins. 
          Without semicolons the program will have a hard time to understand what is written. We can compare this to our written language on how multiple sentences would have looked like without periods. 
          Code blocks groups statements together into a single unit. The syntax here is that the program will read them together and not separately.
        This is convenient when writing, and using functions, loops, or conditional coding. </p>


        <li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li> 

        <p>It will return as "Undefined". </p>


        <li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>

        <p>We separate parameters by using commas and have them within parentheses.</p>


        <li>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>

        <p>When creating functions we want specific parameters sometimes, so by matching the parameter names to what we want makes it easier during the invocation to put in the right input.

        </p>


        <li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li> 

        <p>When the parameter is missing it is not defined which makes it return as undefined.</p>


        <li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions</li>
        
        <p>The function calls upon itself. It has a new parameter for each time. To not make it infinite you have to write a condition to reach to eventually stop.
          An example of this can be seen in part 10</p>
