Use the provided printOut function to print each row with its sets of columns; remember to place this in
the right level of the nested for loops. The output should look like this:

/*Simulate 5 student grades using the Math.random() function, from 1 to 236 (inclusive).
For each grade, print the student's grade (A to F) based on the point distribution provided:
○ A: 89% – 100%
○ B: 77% – 88%
○ C: 65% – 76%
○ D: 53% – 64%
○ E: 41% – 52%
○ F: 0% – 40%
Sorting Challenge (Bonus): Sort and print the 5 grades in descending order (from A to F) without using
an array. You can use a for loop and a do/while loop to achieve this.
Hint for Success: If you successfully complete the sorting challenge, you'll unlock a valuable hint for Part
9 of "DAT101: Mandatory assignment 4.1" that will make it easier to solve. The learning outcomes remain
the same, but this hint will give you a head start!*/
