      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a list in an object form.</p>

      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding")</li>
      <p>It is written so integrated in the code we can't change it later in the code. If we want to change it we have to change that exact line(s) of code. 
        In a way we can't change a const later as a variable, we have to change it at the root.
      </p>

      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>In task 3 we are making a greeting into an array. We are giving each a word in the array a spot. When we (humans) don't know '
        how long the array is we can use .length to find out how long it is.</p>

      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>You can store a lot of information, and store it organized.</p>
      

      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p></p>

      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p></p>

      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs</li>
      <p></p>

      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains</li>
      <p></p>
