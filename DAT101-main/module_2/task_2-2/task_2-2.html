      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				When you know you want the input to be constant, and not change you should put in a constant (const).
        When you know the input is gonna be changed you should use variables (let).
        If you are not going to change the input they all can be constants.
        But mostly one does not want to hard code the code, but make it flexible and have the possibility to make changes easily.
        Therefore one usually don't use const for every input. 
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				As in math the parantheses will affect the outcome. 
        The code will read what is inside the parantheses first and calculate what's inside when running.
        It will return a result where it has calculated what is inside the parantheses first. 
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We have different methods to choose the given number of decimals.
        One can use for example toFixed(), toPrecision() and Math.round().
        The first two will give the exact decimals that are written. Math.round will round up or down the number. 
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can use comparison operators to compare the numbers. We can check them if they are equal by using "==".
        12.199999 is not the same as 12.2 unless you round up the first number. 
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				They return either a FALSE or TRUE depending on the statement. 
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() wil generate a random number between 0 and 1. This can be used to make different programs for example one can make a "Magic 8 ball" that gives you a random fortune. 
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus tells us what is left when the number is divided. For Example 10%3 the code will return us 1.
        As said we can use this operator when we need to now what is left when something is divided.
